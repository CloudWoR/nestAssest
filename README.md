# PROBLEM
I need to set the yaml configuration file in the library file. According to the suggestions of the document, I first define configure in the server folder and configure the asset file path in the nest-cli.json file. Since my project is monorepo mode, I want to share the configuration file in the library (LIBS) file and configure the asset file path in nest-cli.json in the same way, but after running build, the configinlibrary.yaml file in LIBS cannot be copied into the dist folder.
